Introduction:
   what is hibernate framework and their moto:
        It is a framework that is used for talking to database in a better way.
        It provides Object oriented touch to the database layer from the application.
  Benefits hibernate framework provides:
      It provides HQL(Hibernate Query language) where the native query generation is taken care by hibernate framework, due to this
      the changing of databases doesn't require any query changes in the application. (It uses dialect to generate the particular native
      query related to the database).
      It handles all low level SQL.
      It provides caching mechanism.
      it provides entity(POJO) and database objects mapping using hibernate framework(Object-to-Relation mapping)ORM.
      It has annotation support.
      It can provide the pagination feature in a very simpler manner.

class level annotations:
@Entity - This actually makes your class as entity class.
@Table - The place where we provide database table name that should get mapped to the entity.
Field level annotations:
@Id -   This is mandatory annotation that should present in entity or POJO. This represents identifier.
@Column - this maps with the database table column.

-> We will have a configuration file "hibernate.cfg.xml"
     Inside this file we will have configurations that are needed to connect the database.
     The properties that are present are dialect, databaseURL, username, pwd, driver class.

The configuration file will be loaded by using a hibernate config loader class "ServiceRegistry"
